With DeepD3, you are able to predict the presence and absence of 
dendritic spines and dendrites in 3D microscopy stacks. We evaluated
DeepD3 on a variety of species, resolutions, dyes and microscopy types.
In this documentation, you find information how to train your own DeepD3 model,
how to use DeepD3 in inference mode and how to use the API to create custom scripts.
